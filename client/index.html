        Staraptor is the original gangster of the pokemon universe (CONTRARY TO OTHER PEOPLES WRONG OPINIONS)
        </p>
        <br>
       <p>
        Its powerful wing and leg muscles allow it to fly effortlessly while carrying a small or large Pokémon. Upon evolution, this Pokémon leaves its flock to live alone. The reason for this is due to Staraptor being powerful enough to take care of itself. It can be highly aggressive, persistently attacking even larger foes in spite of illness or injury.
